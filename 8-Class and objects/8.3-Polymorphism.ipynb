    "\n",
    "Polymorphism is a powerful feature of OOP that allows for flexibility and integration in code design. It enables a single function to handle objects of different classes, each with its own implementation of method. By understanding and applying polymorphism, you can create more extensible and maintainable object oriented programs."
